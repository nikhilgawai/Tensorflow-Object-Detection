## Demo




### You need to clone these two repository...

Tensorflow :- https://github.com/tensorflow/models

ProtoBuf :- https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
(Download the "protoc.zip" according to your operating system version)

### After extracting protobuf, Copy the "lib", "include" and "readme.txt" files, create a "Google Protobuf" directory to your programming files folder(windows) and /home(linux) and paste it.

### Go to the Tensorflow Extracted Folder(In my case) its :- /home/models/research/object_detection
paste the .ipynb file and video that you will be using for detection.

You can follow this tensorflow object detection documentation for installation and testing API purpose:-
